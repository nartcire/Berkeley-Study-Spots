# Berkeley Study Spots

## The Story

This was a project that was first started in my second semester in a club called Open Project at UC Berkeley! We originally were tasked with trying to develop a library crowd meter, but after extensive research, we had determined that it was not something we could accomplish with our current tools and skillset. Thus, we pivoted to a study spot website because I had wanted to create a resource that new incoming students could possibly use to find the right study spot for them so they can more quickly hit the books once they've arrived to campus. We developed the general design and theme of the website and collected data on a good number of study spots around campus, but I was never able to start coding out the website during the semester due to external problems. I decided to make this a personal project to code out over the summer of 2023 to better understand HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Axios. Additionally, this project had helped give me a better feel for the development process and the functionality of npm. This project does have a working front and back end that do successfully communicate with each other.

## Description

A website that aims to help incoming or current students of UC Berkeley to find potential study spots on campus and on the immediate surrounding area around campus! The website features filtering tools that will filter out study spot listings that do not match / meet the needs and preferences indicated by the user. Additionally, the user can click on the desired listing to open to another page dedicated to the clicked listing where more information can be found about the study spot! Finally, there are small quality of life features where the user can click on the location icon to open a page of google maps of where the listing is located and links to the yelp of the study spot so that the user can more easily decide on their next study spot.

## Tech Stack

The project makes use of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to generate the front end of the website. Node.JS and Axios was used to prop up our API. MongoDB is where our database management system lies. The reason for this particular tech stack was mainly for me to learn how to fully flesh out a website for the first time. I decided on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS because I wanted to learn and build upon the very basics of front end development, while Node.JS and Axios was used because I had found online that they work well with each other in making an API that will communicate with our database. I decided on MongoDB because I needed a proper database to store the data collected by my team.

## How To Run The Website

If you are wanting to run this project, please do note that the backend is ran on a basic server that is ran on localhost at the moment so you would need to break the CORS policies in order for the front end to communicate with our API that communicates with MongoDB for our desired data. I use a google chrome extension to bypass the CORS policies in order to do this. This of course is not practical, but this project mainly serves to help show case what I've learned so far, and I hope to learn more in the future!

## Credits

I would like to thanks my teammates at Open Project. Although I wasn't the best lead for this project, I appreciate the work that they were able to accomplish before the end of our semester. They were able to compile some data for me about various study spots that they knew about around campus and provided great input and feedback concerning the design of the website! Leading the team had taught me a lot about how to work and communicate with others in addition to giving me people I can call friends.
