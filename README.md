This was a project that was first started in my first semester in a club called Open Project at UC Berkeley!
We developed the general design and theme of the website and collected data on a good number of study spots around campus, but I was never able to start coding out the website.
I would personally like to give thanks to my team members for collecting data and for giving input on the design of the website!

I decided to make this a personal project to better understand HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Axios. Additionally, this project had helped give me a better feel for the development process and the functionality of npm. This project does have a working front and back end that do successfully communicate with each other.

If you are wanting to run this project, please do note that the backend is run on a basic server that is run on localhost at the moment so you would need to break the CORS policies in order for the front end to communicate with our API that communicates with MongoDB for our desired data. I use a google chrome extension to bypass the CORS policies in order to do this. This of course is not practical, but this project mainly serves to help show case what I've learned so far, and I hope to learn more in the future!

When I first transferred into UC Berkeley, I often found myself spending a lot of time thinking and researching online for study spots around campus! It can be intimidating for new incoming students to go out there and explore all of the different study spots that UC Berkeley and the surround area has to offer, thus I thought up of the idea of creating a website that compiles all of that information together and provides filtering tools to help students find study spots that best suit their needs and preferences!
